# Dicee_Challenge

The project is inspired by the thought of ending all arguments of humankind by randomization. Although it's frailty is easily seen in weighty decisions which the logical mind would never allow to be decided by randomization, it poses a neat and convienent way to conclude arguments and even provide pleasure while at it.

That being said, the project is a simple dynamic website using the HTML framework, styled with Cascading stylesheets and scripted with Javascript to simulate dice roll behaviours.
