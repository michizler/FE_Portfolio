# Drum_Kit

This project is pretty simple, borne out of pure curiousity to simulate drum rolls. Just a personal kit for a user to play around with. Started out quite generic, with the usual HTML skeleton and CSS to make the site look good and wear out the user's eyes. 

Then the real task was implementing playing sounds for click and keypress events. Worked out the logic after a few research on event listeners using MDN docs. 

Lastly, was implementing a bit of behavioural aesthestics in terms of animations. Research also brought me to a handy method in Javascript -- the `setTimeout` method. That really helped put the icing on the cake.
